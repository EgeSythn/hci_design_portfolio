        <span class="d-none d-sm-inline-block"><h3>What is Universal Design?</h3></span>
        <p class="indent">Design is everywhere. The tools we use, 
          the technology we interact with and even the environment 
          we walk in are all designed with certain goals and 
          ambitions. What is not everywhere, however, is a consideration
          of how these designs came to be and whether they are adequate.
          Even when we consider design we often have 
          a very narrow perspective to how things around us are designed.
          Our considerations are limited to our desires and abilities.
          However, a designer cannot have such narrow perspectives when
          they are constructing designs that will be used by people
          with very different abilities.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          And here, we encounter a very important problem: how do we make
          our designs accessible to everyone, regardless of their different
          abilities? What principles we follow in order to be considerate
          of these differences?
          <b>Universal Design</b> is the design approach that emerged from 
          these questions. It is design that aims to be accessible and easily
          usable by a maximal percentage of the population, regardless
          of differences such as age, gender and abilities. It was first 
          developed by a group of architects, product designers, engineers
          and environmental design researchers led by architect Ronald Mace, 
          focusing around seven core principles.
        </p>
        <img class="img1" src="principles.png" alt="Principles of Universal Design">
        <p class="indent">
          Guided by these seven core principles, researchers have established
          certain goals that universal design is aimed at achieving.
        </p>
        <img class="img1" src="goals.png" alt="Goals of Universal Design">
        <span class="d-none d-sm-inline-block"><h3>So What is the Issue?</h3></span>
        <p class="indent">
          The overarching ambition behind universal design is to 
          create a better world, that is accessible and equitable
          for everyone. This is a hard problem to tackle, especially
          considering that most of the design around us is not exactly
          cohesive in their accessibility. It is not just the responsibility
          of designers to follow the conventions of Universal Design,
          but also <b>lawmakers to ensure that our society is considerate
          of the different abilities of its members</b>. There has been 
          certain developments in this area, with the 
          <a style="color: inherit;" href="https://www.ada.gov/">
          Americans with Disability Act of 1990</a>, or the 
          <a style="color: inherit;" 
          href="https://dfaeurope.eu/what-is-dfa/dfa-documents/the-berlin-act-2005/">
          The EIDD Stockholm Declaration of 2004</a>. Such developments
          have certainly made accessible design more visible, however,
          certainly certain elements of our environment are still not
          following the Universal Design ambitions we discussed earlier.

        <p class="indent">
          When we consider the Universal Design principles and goals
          in the context of software, the problem gets much more 
          complicated and obscure. In our day and age, our lives have
          become much more reliant on software products, especially
          in terms of our daily reliance on the web. Containing countless
          websites, resources, and integral technologies that many people
          with different abilities use, the web is perhaps one of the areas
          where Universal Design hasn't been able to penetrate.
        </p>
        <br />
        <span class="d-none d-sm-inline-block"><h3>Problems We Experience</h3></span>
        <p class="indent">
          Accessibility problems, and lack of Universal Design considerations
          are visible to most of us. Universal Design doesn't just make
          design more accessible for people with different abilities
          but overall <b>makes design more usable for everyone</b>. The web has
          many problems due to the sheer amount of websites and webtools
          that exist. And you as a person, with no self proclaimed disabilities
          or accessibility issues, might have experienced such problems. 
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          Consider the accessibility of websites on mobile devices, which
          is a problem that is often very easy to overlook. The goal for
          developers, unfortunately, are often to make their software functional, rather
          than accessible and easily usable for many people. And this is not
          completely their fault, as a society we don't often have this debate
          in depth. Doing so would reveal the countless pains that are experiences
          by people around the world, and lead to better designs.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          For example,
          if you ever couldn't press a button while on your mobile device
          because the button was not large enough for your thumb, then you have
          encountered a very common accessibility problem. Going back
          to our Universal Design principles, this is a mishap in terms of
          "Size and Space" and is a lacking feature when it comes to our
          overarching goal of having a design that fits to different body sizes ("Body Fit").
          This is not just experienced by people who have potato fingers,
          such as me, but is also more problematic when people with motor
          disorders or disabilities are considered. Fine motor controls
          are sometimes assumed by developers to be a given when
          extensive functionality is attempted to be crumbled into the 
          limited screen real estate of a mobile phone. When Considering even
          such a minor detail causing such common problems, we can see that design is 
          not something that can be overlooked, as the results <b>will</b> be noticable. 
          Now, there are certain cases where such problems might not be a major consideration,
          as people are generally clever and will find workarounds around common problems. But, that
          is again against our Universal Design principles, such as "Tolerance for Error" or "Low Physical Effort".
          We cannot expect people to find workarounds to problematic designs, as doing so will take away from
          the experience a product provides its users with.
        </p>
        <img class="img1" src="tinyscreen.gif" alt="Improper Sizing">
        <p class="indent">
          Such problems are all to common, and can be 'annoying'
          for some users and debilitating for a lot of other users.
          Exploring design decisions that have been made for things
          that we use on a daily basis reveals how design often
          remains a cosmetic tools rather than providing comfort
          and adequate support for people of all abilities. However,
          Universal Design, when cleverly implemented, can lead to benefits
          for everyone. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <span class="d-none d-sm-inline-block"><h3>What Can We Do?</h3></span>
        <p class="indent">
          The ideas that are brought-forth with Universal Design
          are important, but there is a lack of lawmaker consideration,
          and tools that limit certain aspects of Universal Design to actually
          materialize. Thankfully, there has been a lot of improvement
          in this area. After ADA, <a style="color: inherit;" href="https://www.section508.gov/">Section 508</a>
          is a valuable portion of the Rehabilition Act that focuses on
          IT Accessibility. <a style="color: inherit;" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">
          Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</a> is a 
          wide range of recommendations for accessibility improvements
          for Web content. Tools such as <a style="color: inherit;" href="https://achecker.achecks.ca/checker/index.php">
          AChecker Web Accessibility Checker</a>, <a style="color: inherit;" href="https://wave.webaim.org/">
          Wave</a>, and <a style="color: inherit;" href="https://www.accessibilitychecker.org/">Accessibility Checker</a> are making developers' lives easier. Research on accessibility has
          also sped up, with aforementioned tools being used to analyze web accessibility (Macakoğlu, 2022).
          We are slowly moving to a world where accessibility is not an afterthought but an aspect of life
          that needs to be prioritized and scrutinized with modern tools and research efforts.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          However, we still need to have this debate on a much more central level, as design dictates
          how we interact with everything. Such a core part of our live often doesn't get the attention it needs
          and this level of inaction perpetually creates accessibility problems, considering the rapid nature
          of development in software.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          During the Covid-19 outbreak, for example, public health websites
          were crucial in providing information to the public. However, an
          evaluation of 25 public health website landing webpages, from
          24 different countries revealed that only 3 webpages passed 
          AChecker tool in terms of their compliance to WCAG 2.0 Guidelines (Alajarmeh, 2022)
          The implications of failing to uphold Universal Design principles can and do have
          consequences that are often devestating. Information that can mean life and death may not be
          accessible to everyone. Such recent examples show us that we need to think about the big 
          picture when it comes to design.
        </p>
        <img class="img1" src="data.webp" alt="Alajarmeh, 2022 - WebPages ranked on errors in W3C HTML and CSS Validators">
        <p class="indent">
          Accessibility and Universal Design shouldn't be just left to designers and developers, but
          must be embraced universally by the general public. Understanding the varying nature of 
          human abilities and needs that accompany it will influence interactions we have with each other,
          our environment, and our technology. So, the next time you get slightly frustrated over a stair, 
          a door, a mobile app, or a website, think about what this design means for everyone. Think about
          what Universal Design stands for and how it can be implemented more ubiquitously in our lives.
          Good design doesn't always mean extensive research and design updates, but sometimes incremental 
          changes that arise from daily observations. The goal should be to make life easier, and this goal
          is achievable with the aggregate effort of humanity.
